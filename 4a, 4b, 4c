You can also customize and parameterize this project after it is recorded. To exemplify this, let’s take the Desktop recording example and build upon it.
For example, let’s assume that we want to extract the number of an invoice from an Excel file, copy it to a new Notepad application which we close in the end.

1.	Add an Excel Application Scope activity before the recording sequence.
2.	In the WorkbookPath field, type the path of the Excel file you need to extract information from.
3.	Add a Read Cell activity in the Excel Application Scope.
4.	In the Properties panel, add the Sheet Name and Cell information from the Excel file used.
5.	Right-click in the Result field, and click Create Variable. The Set Name field is displayed.
6.	Fill in the name, such as genInvoiceNumber, and press Enter. The variable of type 'GenericValue' is created and displayed in the Result field and Variables panel.
7.	Change the scope of the variable to Main.
8.	In the recording sequence, in the Type Into activity, in the Text field, add
the genInvoiceNumber variable. This copies the value stored in the variable to Notepad. What was added to the project should look as in the following screenshot.















 


 

 




9.	Add an Open Application activity between Excel Application Scope and the Recording sequence.
10.	Use Indicate window on screen to select the active Notepad window.
11.	Place the Recording sequence inside the Open Application activity.
12.	Add a Close Application activity after Open Application.
13.	Use Indicate window on screen again to select the active Notepad window to be closed.
14.	Make sure the OffsetX and OffsetY properties (Cursor Position) are empty. What was added to the project should look as in the following screenshot.

15.	Press F5. The automation is executed as expected.

Conclusion : Thus we have studied to Automate Any Process Using Basic Recording.
